# swaybar-data

Note: under significant development, you probably want to wait a bit before
taking into use.

This project will provide easy way to get data for your swaybar, in plain and
swaybar-protocol flavors. Data will be sourced in asynchronous manner if
possible, meaning piggybacking on existing (mostly DBus) services instead of
polling sysfs files.
